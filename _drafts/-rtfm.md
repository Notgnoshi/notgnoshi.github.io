title: RTFM - a critique
meta: My thoughts on the RTFM phenomenon; I'm not a fan.
---

I have an [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM) sticker on my laptop, but it's not because I'm in favor of spouting off "RTFM" to any poor noob who had the misfortune of asking a simple question. I have the sticker on my laptop as a reminder to myself that I don't want to live in an RTFM world.

I've been in many circumstances where the "FM" is either incomplete, inaccessible, out of date, or completely absent. Furthermore, I want to live in, and foster an environment where it's okay to ask (and answer) questions. Even (especially) simple questions with pre-existing easy-to-find answers. I want to be a part of an open and welcoming learning environment. Manuals were not made for beginners, they were made for experts as a thorough and concise description of a tool.

The RTFM mindset does nothing to increase the amount of freely available knowledge in the world, and I'm inclined to argue that it even does nothing to *benefit* the world. By answering (or even *pointing* someone to the answer) we leave the world  better than we found it. If everyone RTFM'd, then there would be no need for schools, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), or even [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). Instead, projects like [Proof Wiki](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) benefit everyone, even though their contents lie in an unread dusty manual somewhere on someone's bookshelf.

That isn't to say telling someone to RTFM isn't without its proper use; there are an incredible number of learning resources at your fingertips, and many (if not most) "noob" questions have already been asked and answered countless times and are therefore only a Google search away. However, telling someone to "RTFM" doesn't benefit you, it doesn't benefit them, and it definitely doesn't benefit future Googlers that may come across your response in search of the answer. I do understand the temptation though.

However, I believe we should treat <strike>these</strike> all people with dignity, respect, and patience (deserved because they're human beings). If we can't be bothered to give a constructive answer, at the very least we can point them to the answer a la [LMGTFY](http://lmgtfy.com/). The world (that I want to live in) has no room for pompous assholes tearing into someone for not knowing something.
