* **Numerical analysis notes.**
* Python serial posts.
* **Differential equations** notes. This summer.
* Update out-of-date images on maximization post.
* tags, categories, pagination...
* **Update Jailbreak Post**
* `EmailIP.py`. Both versions. Cron job
* Project Euler solutions
* Domain name & VPS
* VPN
* Bitwise reverse and counting in C
* `tikz` and/or `pgfplots`
* Big-O notation
* `sin`/`cos` implementations in C
* **Python tutorial**
* Design Patterns
* `#pragma once`
* Insult Generator
* Abstract/Modern Algebra:
  - definition, motivation
  - Groups, Rings, Fields
* Algebraic graph theory
* Definition/explanation of a limit
* Continuity in terms of open sets.
* Removing `appmenu-qt5` to fix the broken keyboard shortcuts in TeXMaker

The idea that "Continuous functions are ones that can be drawn without picking up your pen" leads us to the idea that the identity function $$x$$ is discontinuous because it takes two strokes of the pen to write.

Random thoughts about questions/notes/lectures in a math course:

* Three typs of questions:
  - Questions of correction
  - Questions of understanding
  - Questions of extension
* What's the purpose of a math lecture? If you learn by *doing* math, then what's the point of attending a lecture?

  I suspect that many people misunderstand the purpose of lectures in a math course. While it *can* happen, most of the time understanding doesn't come from someone telling you something; it happens when you struggle-bus your way through a (hopefully) carefully designed problem. So why attend a lecture? It gives you a topic outline, it can help clear up misunderstandings, and it can serve as an introduction to the ideas you will later learn in depth.

 * Notes:
  - They provide you with something to study from later.
  - Should not be a canonical copy of what was said in the lecture.
