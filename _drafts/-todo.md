* **Numerical analysis notes.**
* Python serial posts.
* Update out-of-date images on maximization post.
* tags, categories, pagination...
* Project Euler solutions
* `tikz` and/or `pgfplots`
* `sin`/`cos` implementations in C
* Design Patterns
* Insult Generator
* Abstract/Modern Algebra:
  - definition, motivation
  - Groups, Rings, Fields
* Algebraic graph theory
* Definition/explanation of a limit
* Continuity in terms of open sets.
* Removing `appmenu-qt5` to fix the broken keyboard shortcuts in TeXMaker
* Little fixes to programs like the Matlab scrolling issue I ran into
* Complex proofs and definitions


Random thoughts about questions/notes/lectures in a math course:

* Three types of questions:
  - Questions of correction
  - Questions of understanding
  - Questions of extension
* What's the purpose of a math lecture? If you learn by *doing* math, then what's the point of attending a lecture?

  I suspect that many people misunderstand the purpose of lectures in a math course. While it *can* happen, most of the time understanding doesn't come from someone telling you something; it happens when you struggle-bus your way through a (hopefully) carefully designed problem. So why attend a lecture? It gives you a topic outline, it can help clear up misunderstandings, and it can serve as an introduction to the ideas you will later learn in depth.
