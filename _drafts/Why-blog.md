As a first post, I think I should attempt to explain why I am blogging, and what I hope to gain out of it.

I have decided to create a blog as a result of Matt Might's blog [post](http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-blog-as-an-academic/) about blogging as an academic. What I took away from his post was that blogging has personal benefits. If there are things I wish to remember, I should blog about them. If there are things I am having difficulty understanding, I should write about them so that I become more familiar, and increase my understanding.

Really, my reasons for blogging at the moment have nothing to do with other people reading what I have to say, and more to do with me saying it.

I hope to better polish my writing skills and to use this as motivation to finish the myriad of projects floating around my desk. Above all else though, I hope to use this as a learning opportunity.
