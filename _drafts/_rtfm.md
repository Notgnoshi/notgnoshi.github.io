title: RTFM - a critique
meta: My thoughts on the RTFM phenomenon; I'm not a fan.
---

I have an [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM) sticker on my laptop, but it's not because I'm in favor of the RTFM mindset. I have the sticker as a reminder to myself that I don't want to live in an RTFM world.

I've been in many circumstances where the "FM" is either incomplete, inaccessible, out of date, or completely absent. Furthermore, I want to live in, and foster an environment where it's okay to ask (and answer) questions. Even (especially) simple questions with pre-existing easy-to-find answers. I want to be a part of an open and welcoming learning environment. Manuals were not made for beginners, they were made for experts as a thorough and concise description of a tool.

The RTFM mindset does nothing to increase the amount of freely available knowledge in the world. By answering (or even *pointing* someone to the answer) we leave the world  better than we found it. If everyone RTFM'd, then there would be no need for schools, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), or even [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). Rather, projects like [Proof Wiki](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) benefit everyone, even though their contents lie in an unread dusty manual somewhere on someone's bookshelf.

That isn't to say telling someone to RTFM isn't without its proper use cases; there are an incredible number of learning resources at your fingertips, and many (if not most) "noob" questions have already been asked and answered countless times and are only a Google search away. But I strongly feel that we should graciously treat people with patience regardless of how they act or present themselves.
