title: "Asciinema: Record Your Terminal"

A while ago I was looking for a tool to record my terminal as a GIF. What I found instead was a neat little tool called [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) that records a terminal session to a JSON file. Asciinema then converts this JSON file into a "video" for lack of a better word. This is cool, because Asciinema's JavaScript playback window lets viewers copy and paste whatever was recorded. You can embed the playback windows anywhere you can use `<script>... </script>` tags.

Asciinema's website does a pretty dang good job of showing off its capabilities, and an even better job of going over how to install and configure it, so I won't go over any of that here. Instead, you should head over to their [website](https://asciinema.org/) and check it out!
