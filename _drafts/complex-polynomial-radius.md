title: Complex Polynomial Inequality Verification
meta: The verification of a complex polynomial inequality as stated in my Complex Analysis textbook
---

**Defn.** For $$z, a_i \in \mathbb C$$ and $$n \in \mathbb R^+$$

$$P(z) = a_0 + a_1 z + a_2 z^2 + \dots + a_n z_n$$

with $$a_n \neq 0$$ (i.e. has a $$n$$th term) is called a *polynomial* of degree $$n$$.

**Inequality.**

$$\left\vert\frac{1}{P(z)}\right\vert < \frac{2}{\vert a_n\vert R^n}$$

whenever $$\vert z\vert > R$$ for some $$R \in \mathbb R^+$$. In other words, $$\left\vert\frac{1}{P(z)}\right\vert$$ is bounded above by $$\frac{2}{\vert a_n \vert R^n}$$ when $$z$$ is sufficiently large.

**Verification.**
