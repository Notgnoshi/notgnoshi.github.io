title: An Interesting Integral
---

One of my professors proposed the following interesting problem:

$$ \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \cos(k x) \cos^n(x) \,\,\text{d}x \text{, for } k, n \in \mathbb{Z}$$

What makes this interesting is that according (at least I think so...) to the even/oddness of $$k + n$$ the integral evaluates to either 0 or some irrational number.

This has something to do with the product to sum identity

$$ \cos(a)\cos(b) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\cos(a + b) + \cos(a -b)\right)$$

Depending on the even/oddness of $$n$$ it expands to some version of

$$\cos(x)\cos(x)\dots\cos(x)$$

Which evaluates to different things depending on how many terms there are (0 to $$2 \pi$$).
