title: The definition of mathematics
meta: A collection of various non-rigorous anecdotal definitions of what mathematics is
---

Every time I tell someone that I'm studying math in school (even if I tell them it's "applied") they almost always respond with some form of *"So you want to be a teacher?"* This response infuriates me; in one statement my convictions that math is awesome and is not something that should only be perpetrated on some lowly undeserving corner of society is summarily invalidated.

At a deeper level than the immediate disbelief of the (in my opinion) fact that *mathematics is actually useful*, I believe this type of response indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of what mathematics really is. And while I can fault people for letting their hatred of math misguide them into believing that it simply isn't useful, I cannot fault them for not understanding what math really is. This is because every time *I* attempt to define it, I invariably come up short.

It seems that whatever definition I force on mathematics, there is inescapably a sub-discipline of mathematics that refuses to fit. For example, because I'm attending an engineering school studying *applied* mathematics, my first attempt at a definition was that mathematics is the process of modeling the natural world. I believe this is incomplete. Building models of the world around us is how we *use* math, and falls short of capturing what math *is*.

According to the Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_mathematics) on the subject, which as we all know is infallible, there is no accepted definition of mathematics. So what I wanted to do here is list a number of different definitions, mostly anecdotal, and hope that via [proof by kitchen sink](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/lecture-3-strong-induction/MIT6_042JF10_proof.pdf) what math *really is* starts to show through.

Mathematics is:

* The science of quantity, where discrete quantities are studied by arithmetic and continuous quantities are studied by geometry.
* The science of indirect measurement.
* The science that draws necessary conclusions.

  Mathematics doesn't rely on empirical evidence, yet yields "true" results. Science relies on empirical evidence and yields verifiable "truthness".

* The classification and study of patterns.

  G. H. Hardy wrote "A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas" in *A Mathematician's Apology*.

* A broad-ranging field of study in which the properties and interactions of idealized objects are examined.
* The exploration of logical consequences.
* Davis and Hersh say "The study of mental objects with reproducible properties." in *The Mathematical Experience*

  I'm not sure about the use of "mental objects" as it sounds like they're objects we've invented. Rather, we've simply invented the language; the results exist regardless.

* An impossibly vast imagination game, where the only rule is not to lie.

  This one's interesting and pleasant to me; it exposes the abstractness and emphasizes the playfulness of mathematics.

* Recursively, what mathematicians do, where mathematicians are people who "do mathematics".
* The subset of academia written in $$\LaTeX$$
* "Physics unconstrained by precepts of reality" according to [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1052/).
* "The poetry of logical ideas." according to Einstein.
* The study of what is possible (or "true") in a given system.
* That which occurs when you combine the ability to reason with the ability to represent ideas with symbols.

It seems there are as many definitions for mathematics as there are mathematicians. I wouldn't take that as a negative commentary on mathematics though, rather I think it emphasizes that mathematics is an art despite also being a formal science.
