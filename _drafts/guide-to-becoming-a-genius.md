title: An Old Friend's Guide to Becoming a Genius

To start off, I don't condone any of this, but have found myself returning to it every now and then for a good laugh.

I probably shouldn't have to say this, but everything on this list is a bad idea (in varying degrees). I can honestly say though, that if this was the worst we could come up with, we were doing pretty good.

* Eat plastic
* Smoke filters
* Drink swamp water
* Laugh at crying women you've never met before
* Carry old ladies from halfway across the street to the side they came from against their will
* Ride motorcycles without a helmet
* Eat more plastic
* Microwave with the door open (disable the "safety" switch)
* Use iPhone as beer coaster
* Pet your animals from tail to head only
* Experiment with drugs while on drugs
* Overdose on placebos
* Pay money for water
* Fill car with diesel in the winter instead of gas.
* Bleach your car fuel to create clean energy (one gallon should do)
* Tan for 5 hours every day (takes years off your life)
* Dumpster dive
* Activate inflatable life vest during takeoff on a commercial plane
* Cook with antifreeze (I hear it tastes like Kool-Aid)
* Eat the Styrofoam box your burger comes in and throw away the sandwich
* Wrap a teabag in plastic and claim you invented waterproof tea
* Sell dehydrated buckets of water in the desert (instructions: just add water)
* Get pulled over for speeding. In reverse
* Pee on other people's shoes in the next stall
* Don't drink and drive. Drive and drink
* Buy a digital wrist watch and claim you wear it for fashion
* Don't read this
* Eat a 500 year old redwood. The whole thing
* Breathe water. It'll help you stay hydrated
* Roll around in radioactive waste (superpowers baby!)
* Stay in a tanning booth for 15 hours to get the tan of your life
* Chew nails. Your body needs iron
* Put your head in a lions head
* Tease a hungry rabid dog with a bone
* Swim while eating a big meal
* Cover your chest in peanut butter and lay down in a dog park. Bring your own dog so its not so creepy
