title: Lockhart's Lament
---

I just received my copy of the full book version of [Lockhart's Lament](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf). I'm really excited to read it, but I'm far too busy for a detailed reading at the moment.

I've read the essay version that I linked above, and it's something that's really stuck with me. Maybe it's because I'm a musician and Lockhart opens by comparing math to art and music, and particularly what would happen if we taught music the same way we teach math.

I'm looking forward to reading it, and maybe even posting a small response on here.
