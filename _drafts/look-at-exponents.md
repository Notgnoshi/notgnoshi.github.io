I read a dude's post yesterday about teaching exponents to grade schoolers. He stated that the typical representation of exponentiation as repeated multiplication might not break down per say when the exponent wasn't a positive integer, but it certainly wasn't intuitive. He then offered a better alternative: exponentiation is just an operation that makes $$ x^a a^b = x^{a+b} $$. We can see that the repeated multiplication view fits this:

Now lets talk about negative, fractional, and zero exponents.
