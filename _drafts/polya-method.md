meta: A short description of the Polya problem solving method.

In 1995, [George Polya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_PÃ³lya) wrote a book titled "How to Solve It" detailing his formulation of problem solving strategies. The book was then translated into English in 2004.

This is an outline of the problem solving method Polya introduces in his book.

1. Understand the problem
    * What are the unknown(s)?
    * What is the data?
    * What is the condition?
    * Draw pictures, introduce *suitable* notation.
    * Attempt to separate the problem into various parts.
2. Devise a plan
    * Have you seen this problem or a similar problem before?
    * Do you know a related problem?
    * Try to think of a familiar problem having the same or similar unknown.
    * Can you restate the problem?
    * Find the connection between the given/known data and the unknown.
    * You many have to consider similar problems to make secondary and tertiary connections if you can't make an immediate connection between what you know and what you want.
    * If you cannot solve the proposed problem, then try to solve some related problems. Try problems more general, or more specific.
    * Can you solve part of the problem?
    * Keep only part of the required condition, and attempt to solve the problem without the other part.
    * How far is the unknown from the given data? Can you obtain anything useful from the data?
    * What data do you need to find the unknown data?
    * Can you change the unknown? What about the data? Both?
    * Write yourself a small outline or paragraph for larger problems. Often, writing down the problem statement cements your understanding of what exactly you're looking for.
3. Carry out your plan
    * Carry out your plan of the solution, and check each step as you go along.
    * Can you check that each step is correct? Can you *prove* that they are correct?
4. Examine the obtained solution
    * Can you check the result?
    * Is it possible to obtain the same result in a different manner?
    * Can you use the result, or even the method, for some other problem?

I would recommend reading Polya's book, as he goes into far more detail than this simple outline. Polya wrote his book for math students and teachers, but it's applicable to *any* problem significant enough to be difficult to solve. I would particularly recommend paying more attention to steps 1 and 4, as they're what I usually neglect, and I suspect others neglect them too.
