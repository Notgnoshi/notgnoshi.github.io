title: RTFM - a critique
meta: My thoughts on the RTFM phenomenon; I'm not a fan.
---

I have an [RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM) sticker on my laptop, but it's not because I'm in favor of the RTFM mindset. I have the sticker as a reminder to myself that I don't want to live in an RTFM world.

I've been in many circumstances where the "FM" is either incomplete, inaccessible, out of date, or completely absent. Furthermore, I want to live in, and foster an environment where it's okay to ask (and answer) questions. Manuals were not made for beginners, they were made for experts as a thorough and concise description of a tool.

The RTFM mindset does nothing to increase the amount of freely available knowledge in the world. By answering (or even *pointing* someone to the answer) we leave the world  better than we found it. If everyone RTFM'd, then there would be no need for technical schools, [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), or even [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). Rather, projects like [Proof Wiki](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) benefit everyone, even though their contents lie in an unread dusty book somewhere on someone's bookshelf.

That isn't to say telling someone to RTFM isn't without its proper use cases, but I strongly feel that we should treat people with patience because not everyone has our skill level, and we don't have the skill level others have.
