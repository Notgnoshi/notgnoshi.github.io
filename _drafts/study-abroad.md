title: Studying Abroad
---

Today I attended an informational meeting at my school on some of the more prestigious scholarships available to SDSMT students. Most were for graduating seniors look at graduate school. But more interestingly, all of the scholarships were for studying abroad, so much of the meeting was spent talking about studying abroad. Sadly, I wasn't able to make it to the actual meeting on studying abroad, but I'm only a freshman, so there'll be many more opportunities ahead.

I've never really thought about studying abroad, but the more I think about it, the more I find that I really want to. It might be just the simple allure of travelling, but the advantages and learning opportunities of studying in another country are attractive to me as well.

Writing has a way of solidifying your thoughts, so I wanted to write about what I was thinking on studying abroad. Specifically, I want to concretize the attractiveness and some of the concerns I have about it.

#### The Allure:

* It's abroad!
* It sounds awesome.
* It would look pretty good on a resume.
* I'd learn a lot.
* I'd expand my horizons.
* I really love travelling.

#### The Concerns:

* $$$
* I'm from a very rural area. The nearest town doesn't even have paved roads. The very thought of living in a densely populated area sends panic through my heart. I need open spaces and alone time.
* Language and cultural barriers.
* Being all alone super duper far from home. Hmmm, that might go in the above list.
* I'm not sure how I would measure up intelligence-wise against other students both internationally and against other students competing for these scholarships and study opportunities.

I'm almost certain that what I'm actually concerned about isn't in the above list, but I'm not really sure what makes me so nervous about it. I just listed what came to mind.

#### The Reality:

I don't really know what I'm talking about.
