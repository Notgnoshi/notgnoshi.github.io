I recently finished a small bit of cleaning and found some of my old writing projects from a creative writing class I despised. Now I don't really mind writing, but I prefer to write about something that interests me; these few poorly-written selections were something I actually somewhat enjoyed in a place I hated. Looking back, I'm not sure why I want to keep these around or even post them on the internet, but what the hell?

The following two stories are supposed to be a response to a picture by [Harris Burdick.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mysteries_of_Harris_Burdick)

## Uninvited Guests

It was the year 3874, during the snowy month of July. The Earth had just began to recover after a catastrophic series of events. Almost three millennia earlier a nuclear war between the world's super powers took place. The war lasted just over five hours with no clear winner. In fact, it could be said that everyone lost. Global warming was no longer an issue it would seem, as those fateful few hours caused world-wide winter.

However, out story doesn't lay in the global temperature, but in the radiation left behind from the Biblically proportionate explosions. This radiation caused a host of mutations and disease, most of which were damaging. The one exception however, was that mice evolved the ability to speak, revealing a previously hidden intellect.

Enter Comescu, a paranoid mouse of below average intelligence, which a host of mental and emotional disabilities. Had Comescu had the opportunity to visit with one of the non-existent doctors of post-apocalyptic Earth, he might have became famous in the equally non-existent medical textbooks. On the Geisick-Loophoff Scale of Animal Intelligence Comescu would have scored a measly 3.7 out of 7 if the testing methods of ancient times were known today.

The schizophrenic mouse sat in his humble abode reading *The Mousely Times*. Particularly interesting to Comescu was the Conspiratorial section of the daily publication, which he obsessed over. Today's edition had a particularly well-thought-out and provoking piece on the alleged brainwashing of mice with the remaining human government. The reason stated for the alleged atrocities was fear. Fear of the intellectually superior race of mice.

Enraged at the mistreatment of his fellow mice, Comescu quickly wrote the following response to the inspiring conspiratorial.

> Felow mouses! Felow countrymen! You will remember an artikl wich appeered in this estemed publicashun yesterday. The artikl bought  attenshun to the greevus acts by the human governmet. The tyranists seek to destroi the mouse kingdom. This threat must be met! We cannot allow out apreeshun to be farthur continues. We must make our stand. Felow brotherses! The opresiv tyrany of the to-legs must end!

I'm not sure what the editors of the publication were thinking, but they published his response and it was well-received. However, inciting a social movement had unforeseen consequences for Comescu.

It all began after he spoke at an underground convention of anarchist mice. During his speech he noticed two of the mice in the very back were watching him with bored expressions. Somewhat frustrated, Comescu began to grow more and more passionate as he spoke, moving back and forth on the stage and gesturing with his paws. The more enthusiastic he became however, the more distant the two mice in the back seemed to become.

Forcing the two out of his mind, Comescu instead focused on the other hundreds of mice and reveled in their enthusiasm. All good things must come to an end however, and Comescu soon noticed yawns among the dwindling crowd. Ending his speech, Comescu greeted his fellow anarchists with a secret handshake and stopped at the refreshment table before heading home.

Forsaking his usual twisted route, Comescu instead went straight home, favoring speed over safety. Newton's laws of motion tell us that every action has a consequence, and this was no different. In his exhaustion, Comescu failed to notice two familiar mice following him home. Reaching his home, Comescu plopped down in his favorite recliner (also his only recliner...) and just when he started to doze off, it happened.

His heart was pounding; he was sure he has heard the doorknob turn. He sat upright in his chair, and before he could investigate any further, the door slowly opened. Frozen with fear, Comescu did not, could not react when the two mice from the convention stepped through. Each carried a small aluminum briefcase. They stepped up to Comescu, and before the shaking mouse had a chance to react they had him restrained and gagged.

The shorter of the two mice placed his briefcase on the table and removed some peculiar electronic equipment. Attaching electrodes to the quivering Comescu, the mouse knocked a vase of flowers (weeds, really) off the table, receiving a stiff back-hand from the larger mouse. "Clean it up!" he barked, "I'll take over." After finishing with the electrodes, he opened up his own briefcase and typed into the encased computer.

Comescu promptly lost consciousness. Finishing up, the two mice returned to wherever they came from, leaving the unconscious Comescu on his recliner.

Two days later, Comescu bolted from his sleep. "I'm starving!" he exclaimed. With all due care, the mouse extracted himself from his recliner and stepped on a piece of broken ceramic. "Wonder where that came from?" he muttered. Picking up the shard, he threw it away and made himself a sandwich.

## Under the Rug

It was dark out. Very, very dark out. The Weiss family stood uneasily in front of the window watching the intermittent lightning slice through the storm. The Weiss family was on an extended vacation in Eastern Europe. They were staying in the servant's quarters of an ancient manor. Just recently though, during the complimentary complimentary tour, Robert Weiss, the father, learned that the manor was supposedly haunted by the ghosts of 73 former residents. The words of the tour guide rang in his head: "No one knows how they died, if indeed they did die. For Lord Alucard, master of the manor, was away in Scotland overseeing the shipment of goods at Loch Arkaig. Upon his return, he discovered the manor abandoned. The record of their absence was recored in his journal, in which he made entries daily."

Upon hearing this news, Robert insisted that his family (Jennifer, his wife, and Toma, James, and Rebecca, his children) stay in the servant's cottage behind the main building. Fearful that these ridiculous rumor could be even remotely true, he forbade his children from exploring without supervision. Naturally, Toma and James found this severely cramping to their style. Being young boys, ages 13 and 10 respectively, they had an inherent desire to seek out the very thing Robert Weiss was afraid of, and a night like this was a perfect opportunity.

Being equal opportunity danger-seekers, they forced Rebecca to join them. "Good night, dad!" the boys nearly shouted as the sprinted to the staircase, Rebecca dragging her feet behind them. However, instead of going up the stairs to their respective rooms, they went down the stairs to the cellar.

"Cool!" exclaimed the boys as they lit the lanterns that Toma had absconded from the kitchen earlier that day. Now Rebecca, being the "sensible" one (cowardly, in other words) tried to talk Toma, the instigator, out of entering the tunnel from the servant's lodging to the main building. A tunnel, which, by the way, was completely unlit, providing the boys with ample excitement, for as every boy knows, an unlit musty tunnel provides an excellent haunt for a ghost or 73.

Seeing that James and Toma would not be turned aside by any sort of reason, Rebecca resolved to follow, and being a good 8 year old sister, keep them from harm. Seeing that the light from Toma's lantern was quickly moving away, she lifted her own, which only provided enough light to form ominous shadows on the tunnel walls, and sprinted forwards pleading with the boys to slow down.

As she ran, Rebecca noticed that the light had faded away. Panicked, she ran faster, screaming as two humanoid apparitions jumped out at her from behind a corner, laughing. Angrily, she picked up a rock and lobbed it in the boy's direction. The boys were in no danger of being hit as the rock struck the wall, made an odd clunk, and bounced to the ground.

Intrigued, James and Toma re-lit their lanterns and inspected the rock. Curiously, the rock was hollow and thin, having a consistency and weight similar to that of clay. Knowing now that they had made an important discovery, James, the scientist of the bunch reached down and picked it up. Turning it over, he found two eye sockets and a sinus cavity staring back at him.

This being enough to frighten even the most courageous of boys, the three ran blindly away from the human skull now lying on the tunnel floor.

Terrified, the three kids ran until they could run no more. When they finally collapsed onto the floor, they found themselves in a richly furnished library. The three children, being enthusiastic bookworms, picked themselves up and explored this new discovery, which apparently was enough to erase all memories of the previous incident. Being the oddball of the bunch, James went, instead of to the many shelves, to what seemed to be a display stand.

On this richly carved wooden podium, James found an elaborately embossed leather-bound book. Excited by this discovery, he blew the dust off, pushed away the cobwebs, and opened the cover. Inscribed on the title page, in large gothic print, were these words:

$$\mathcal{The\,Book\,Of\,The\,Dead}$$

Thrilled by this turn of events, James picked up the book. Toma and Rebecca, now noticing that James was not hem-hawing by their side, went over and interrogated James as to what his current form of activity was. "Come on!" James exclaimed, "Let's go back to our rooms, I'll show you there!" Wondering what could be so marvelous to cut short their exploration, they following without objection, paying no attention to a slight skittering sound behind them.

Once they reached their rooms, James reverently placed the book on his bed and ceremoniously opened the cover. His show-and-tell was cut short however, because the ancient door burst open and a black blur burrowed under the rug. Making its way to the children, a mangy black *thing* popped up and demanded the book back. Slamming the centuries-old cover, James stuffed it under his pillow and sat on it. "Never!" he cried, "It's mind, I found it, it's mine!" Just then, Robert and Jennifer Weiss burst through the door, which groaned at the abuse. Startled, the *thing* burrowed back under the rug and disappeared unnoticed through the door.

"What's all the commotion!?" demanded Mr. Weiss. Before Rebecca could explain what they were really doing, as little sisters always seem to do, Toma insisted that they were playing a game that had gotten out of hand. Apparently satisfied by his excuse, Mr. and Mrs. Weiss went back downstairs to finish their now cold tea. Afraid the *thing* would come back, the three terrified children huddled around the book on James's bed and, after some time, fell asleep.

The Weiss family stayed for some time at the manor, and the children put the incident out of their minds until the day before they left for Germany. Two weeks past, and it happened again. The thing cam burrowing under the rug and demanded the book back.

Instead of claiming it as his own however, James inquired of the creature why it wanted the book back. In an ancient lisp, the thing responded. "My master instructed me to guard this book, and I must have it back, for Count Alucard is a terrible master. I will surely be punished!" Scoffing, James told the thing about what the tour guide had told them. "Nay!" the creature shouted "Count Alucard is not dead, for he is beyond death! This is why he desires the book guarded, it contains the secret to his death! You would be wise to fear him, have you not heard the stories of him?"

"Nope," responded James "never."

"Perhaps not by *that* name, I suppose" responded the creature, "but possibly by another? Reverse his name. Have you not heard the stories?"

Startled, the shocked child stood there dumbly as the creature snagged the book, burrowed beneath the rug, and was never heard from again.

This last one was supposed to be a fictional origin story of something. I chose to explain the origins of music.

## How Music Came to Be

The fortress sat overlooking the valley, illuminated by the lightning that sliced through the oppressive darkness, rain pouring down around it. Perched on the craggy peak high above the valley bottom, it seemed to loom over the approaching visitor. Gustav, weary from a long day of ceaseless travel, stopped hesitantly, fearful of what might happen if he approached too close to the monstrosity looming before him. Gustav was a superstitious man living in a superstitious time. It almost seemed worth it to sleep outside in the drenching rain than to impress seemingly imminent doom upon himself by seeking shelter from the rain.

As Gustav Adolphus stood there, contemplating his actions, he became of an extremely strong urge to seek out the castle. Terrified at how strong the urge was, Gustav wondered what could have caused it.

"I would be subjecting myself to the utter whims of the inhabitants!" he thought to himself, suddenly fearful of what could be inside. Gustav looked around for makeshift shelter. Finding nothing immediately apparent, he decided to search the crags above him. Almost slipping to his death (twice) on the slippery rocks, he found himself under an overhang. Gustav immediately began to search for any suitable firewood in the intermittent light from the flashing sky. Seeing a spot further under the overhang that seemed darker than the rest, he decided to search there for anything dry enough to burn. Once he reached it however, he found there was a good reason for its darkness: there was nothing there. He had found a hole in the rock; a cave leading to parts unknown.

Again, Gustav was aware of a nearly irresistible urge to explore. This time, however, he did not refuse, but instead welcomed a chance to forget his weariness of ceaseless traveling. As Gustav wormed his way through the hole, he noticed something that gave him pause: it did not grow darker as his body blocked the light from the intermittent lightning outside.

Instead, it seemed to grow even lighter as he entered. Shrugging his shoulders as much as he could in such a tight space, he continued, pulling his pack behind him. Hoisting the pack onto his shoulders, he spun and found himself in a tunnel.

Exhaustion now completely forgotten, he let the urge to explore take control; continuing down the tunnel which grew increasingly brighter. Intrigued, he trudged forward, light preceding him, beckoning him to follow to whatever secrets lay at the end of the tunnel.

On Gustav walked, until he found himself at the foot of a circular stone staircase. This discovery filled him with dread, because there was only one place he could now be: in the castle. Still, despite his reluctance, the light beckoned him. Faced with the threat of imminent darkness, he followed.

Up the stairs the unlikely pair went, the weird light and he, until they found themselves in a room with several doors. The light apparently knew where to go, and Gustav followed it through one of the doors, noting to himself that it was not the door he would have chosen.

Nonetheless, Gustave followed the light into yet another passageway. On they went, the light and he, through numerous passageways and rooms, never stopping. Sensing the lights increasing impatience, Gustav found himself speeding up, eventually running through the fortress. On they went until the light led him to a single door. Not waiting for him, the light passed right through the door, leaving Gustav in darkness.

Hesitantly, Gustav entered this final room, and immediately dropped to his knees. He did not know what to think, or even feel, as he had never heard such a beautiful sound. Gustav did not know what to call what he was hearing, or even how to describe it. Gustav had never learned so much from something so emotional before. Previously he had equated emotionality with foolishness and stupidity, and as he was a man of learning, Gustav would have shunned such a display of emotion.

However, what he heard had such an impact on Gustav that he packed as many of the ancient parchments in the room into his bag; somehow he knew the secret to these sounds was hidden in them. Hurriedly, he yanked out all the supplies from his pack to make more room for the papers. Quickly, he pushed open the door and ran through the passageways, somehow knowing his way through the maze of corridors. Through the tunnel he ran, seeing the world in a new light, until he reached the opening he originally clambered through. Pulling his load of precious papers behind him, Gustav climbed through the hole, not caring about the gouges the rough rock had given him.

Through the hole he clambered, until he was again underneath the rock outcropping. Through the rain he ran, covering his pack with his body, sprinting, never stopping, ignoring his exhaustion. Only his cargo mattered, nothing else; not the gouges from the rock, not the scrapes from his slide down the drenched mountainside.

Gustav knew one thing - he must get home, where he could analyze and hopefully reproduce what he had heard in the fortress he had invaded. On he ran, for days, until at last his dwelling was in sight. With a leap of welcome, Gustav burst through the door, ready to lay aside his burden now that they were safe, when he found someone else laying in his bed. Pulling off the covers, he shook --

Up he jerked, with a gasp. Gustav Adolphus had dreamed! Wonderful dreams! He remembered every single vivid detail; the uncharted lands had been the human intellect, and the impregnable fortress was his innermost thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Yes emotions, Gustav was not quite as impassive as he had once thought. Hurriedly, he reached for his bag -- it contained his entire supply of parchment, on which he strove to relate the entirety of his dream.

Gustav Adolphus spent the rest of his life bent over his desk, researching, and developing a system of tone production. Thus music came to be.
