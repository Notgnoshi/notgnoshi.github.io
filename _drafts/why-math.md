## Introduction

Almost every time I visit family for the holidays I get asked something along the lines of "Why math?!" or "So you want to be a teacher?". And every time, I struggle to put a good answer together without it being the general and hollow "It helps with general problem solving and logical thinking". I mean, half of that answer is my sister's defense of her history degree!

So this is the question I'd like to attempt to tackle today: "What good is studying math?". We hear about mystical creatures called *mathematicians* in school, namely as a someone to blame for the weird rules like $$0! = 1$$ or $$x^0 = 1$$, but what does it mean to *be* a mathematician, what does a mathematician *do*, and *why* would anyone ever want to be a mathematician?

I began by writing down a list of all the positive traits I could think of that a mathematician has. Very roughly, they fit into three categories: dealing with definitions, failures, and problems.

## Definitions and Meaning

A mathematician can talk about a single definition for hours, and still have that time be productive. If you walk into a room with 50 people, and ask for the definition of even a simple term, it's quite likely you'll get 50 different definitions. A mathematical definition levels the playing field, and provides a common context for everyone involved.

Further, note that *how* an object is defined brings out its characteristics. If a mathematician is attempting to solve a problem, they must first figure out what the problem actually *is*. Defining a problem is the first step to solving it. However, problems in the real world are rarely so well defined as a problem given in a textbook, and the dreaded "word problems" are no substitute.

For example, many problems in industrial management, process control, etc. may be defined as [Linear Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) problems. Once a problem has been defined as such, Linear Programming provides a number of strategies to bring to bear. The trick however, is to define it as an LP problem.

Even within Linear Programming, there are different ways to define LP problems. The [Simplex Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm) uses linear algebra to define and then solve the problem. [Karmarkar's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karmarkar%27s_algorithm) uses calculus to find a gradient vector, and then linear algebra to project the gradient vector into the feasible set.

The point is, a problem's definition dictates the strategies one can use to solve it. Defining problems is an art that a good mathematics education strives to teach.

Mathematicians also spend a considerable amount of time unpacking the meaning behind definitions, which is another extremely valuable skill. The ability to understand the ramifications of different wordings is very important in today's world of political doublespeak and marketing catchphrases.

Students learn how to unpack the meaning behind a seemingly simple phrase that might have

## Coping with Failure

Depending on the student, mathematics may very well have been their first exposure to failure in an academic sense. Maybe it was a failure to perform some task correctly. Maybe it was failure to understand some abstract thought, learn some kind of general strategy, and then apply that strategy to a concrete example.

Even now as I near the end of my math degree, I constantly fail. I fail to understand. I fail to extract big ideas from small examples, and I fail to solve small problems with big tools.

I hope that I never stop failing, because that means I've stopped learning. Failure is an important part of mathematics, but it's also an important part of life. There are a select few individuals who never fail at mathematics, and there are also a very select few individuals that never fail at anything in life. I do not fall into either category, and I doubt I ever will.

One of the most important lessons I've learned from my mathematics education is to be patient and persistent in the face of repeated failure. In a word, I've learned to appreciate failure.

It's hard to not take failure personally. Failing at a task, failing to understand some fundamental idea, or failing to "keep up" with one's peers is not an affront against oneself. Taking failure personally represents a loss of perspective I think. Nothing worthwhile is easy to attain.

Mathematics teaches us *how* to fail; it gives us strategies for failing effectively.

Being open to failure brings humility, which I believe is another hallmark of a good mathematician. Humility is important because it opens oneself to criticism, which is a major tool for sharpening skills.

Jeremy Kun wrote the following in his article on the [habits of highly mathematical people](https://medium.com/@jeremyjkun/habits-of-highly-mathematical-people-b719df12d15e):

> Two mathematicians, Isabel and Griffin, are discussing a mathematical claim in front of a blackboard. Isabel thinks the claim is true, and she is vigorously arguing with Griffin, who thinks it is false. Ten minutes later they have completely switched sides, and now Isabel thinks it’s false while Griffin thinks it’s true.

> I witness scenarios like this all the time, but only in the context of mathematics. The only reason it can happen is because both mathematicians, regardless of who is actually right, is not only willing to accept they’re wrong, but eager enough to radically switch sides when they see the potential for a flaw in their argument.

I think that humility welcomes being wrong. If you are shown to be wrong and accept it, you walk away with more than what you came with. On the other hand, if you are wrong and do not accept it, neither party gains anything. If one seeks to gain understanding and knowledge, shouldn't one welcome being wrong?
