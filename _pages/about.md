My name is Austin, and I'm an applied math student at the [South Dakota School of Mines and Technology](https://www.sdsmt.edu/). I'm extremely boring.

I had someone tell me once that in order to think you had to be able to write. The process of writing requires distilling your thoughts down into discrete logical units. It's a hard skill, and it's worth learning.
