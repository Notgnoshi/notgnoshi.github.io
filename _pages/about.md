My name is Austin Gill, and I'm an applied math student at the [South Dakota School of Mines and Technology](https://www.sdsmt.edu/). I enjoy 4-wheeling in the Rocky Mountains, and recently I've been enjoying being a part of the school robotics team. I think that robotics has furthered my skills and abilities as much as any of my classes. I enjoy programming in Python and C, and my favorite classes so far have been Data Structures and Game Theory, although Abstract Algebra and Linear Algebra are top contenders.

I had someone tell me once that in order to think you had to be able to write. The process of writing requires distilling your thoughts down into discrete logical units. It's a hard skill, and it's worth learning. That's why this blog thing exists. Maybe someday it'll be filled with things worth reading.
