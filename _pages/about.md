My name is Austin. I graduated with a degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the [South Dakota School of Mines and Technology](https://www.sdsmt.edu/) in May of 2018. I'm now working on a Masters degree in Computational Sciences and Robotics from the same department.

I had someone tell me once that in order to think you had to be able to write. The process of writing requires distilling your thoughts down into discrete logical units. It's a hard skill, and one worth learning.
