My name is Austin Gill, and I'm an applied math student at the [South Dakota School of Mines and Technology](https://www.sdsmt.edu/). I enjoy 4-wheeling in the Rocky Mountains, and recently I've been participating in the school robotics team, and have really enjoyed myself. I think I've learned more about programming and working in a team environment from the robotics team than I have in any of my classes. My favorite programming languages are Python and C, and my favorite classes so far have been Data Structures and Game Theory, though Abstract Algebra and Linear Algebra are top contenders.

I had someone tell me once that in order to think you had to be able to write. That's why this blog thing exists. Maybe someday it'll be filled with things worth reading.
