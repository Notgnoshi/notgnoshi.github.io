title: My First Few Weeks as a Freshman
---

I just started my freshman year at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Wooo! Big deal, the wide-eyed freshman at a pretty small school is writing a blog! Wooo! The next few paragraphs will further destroy any confidence you might have mistakenly had in my intelligence, so uhhh, maybe turn back now?

I'm three weeks into a Differential Equations course and so far the content has been pretty cool. However, due to having taken Calc II from a community college over a year and a half ago, my integration is more than a little rusty. Also, even though I "learned" how to work with matrices in college algebra and we never touched them in Calc II, I was a little behind when I realized that was expected prerequisite knowledge.

I'm internally debating writing this paragraph right now. It's embarrassing. In one of the first homework problems there was a super complicated integration problem that took me entirely far too long to finish. Here's the general problem:

$$ \int k\, dx $$

As you can see, the answer $$ kx + C $$ is far too complicated for one to calculate without several sheets of scratch paper and lots of caffeine. Also, the special case where $$ k = 0 $$ deserves much careful consideration, of which I was apparently mentally insufficient.

Just today on a quiz in Diff Eq I couldn't figure out how to calculate $$ \int \frac{1}{u^2}\, du $$ or $$ \int \frac{1}{u^3}\, du $$. It did not compute that $$ \frac{1}{u^a} $$ is identical to $$ u^{-a} $$ which is easily integratable. However, I am proud of myself for remembering how to integrate $$ -\tan 3x \sec^3 3x $$. It's not terribly complicated, but for someone who wrote the above paragraphs, please, allow me some celebration.

Little things like these make me doubt my future as a math major, but for now I'm going to stick with it because when I'm not feeling like an absolute idiot I greatly enjoy mathemagics.

Now to move away from the negative, I joined a few clubs on campus. Yay! I joined both the robotics team and the UAV team, but I think I will concentrate on only one of them. I also joined a Linux user group and the math club on campus. We'll see how they go. Both the robotics team and the UAV team are programming heavy, using [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) running on [ROS](http://www.ros.org/). I'm fairly familiar with Linux, so ROS shouldn't be too bad, but computer vision is something that I've not only never heard of before, but also sounds very intimidating to someone with meager programming talent. It also sounds fun and seems like a great learning opportunity.
