title: Horror Project
---

I'm taking Horror Literature & Film this semester. Why, I don't know. I'm not a horror fan, but it satisfies an upper level humanities requirement, so I can't complain too much. Anyways, we had to write an original piece of horror as one of our last assignments, and I figured what the hell, if I put this much effort into writing it, I might as well post it. It's not a very good story, but who do you think I am, a writer?

"...and in proving this simple statement, we can show that the subset $A$ of manifold $M$ is, in fact, compact." Melany Cree wished she could focus on what Dr. Kalshok was talking about. She knew that it would be on the next exam, but more than that, Melany knew that formulating advanced proofs was a necessary skill for her to have if she were to ever hold a math research position with any success. The thing is, all Melany could think about was the conversation she overheard a few of the TAs talking about just the day before. It was impossible that it was anything other than a urban legend; such things simply don't happen in real life.

Even still, she was curious. The TAs had seemed serious about it, and from the way their conversation sounded she didn't think it was likely they were making it all up. Anyways, there was an Abstract Algebra exam tomorrow she needed to study for. Studying was probably a more immediate and important use of her time than researching some poor graduate student's demise a full century earlier.

Damn. Dr. Kalshok's lecture was over already. If only they would go that fast when she was paying attention and supposedly learning something. Melany didn't know how long she had been sitting there, but she did notice a small pool of liquid on the desk suspiciously close to where her head was resting on her crossed arms. It had been there before she sat down. The only other option was that she had been drooling in Advanced Calculus, and that just wasn't acceptable.

Melany got up and discretely wiped off her desk. The study rooms in the chemistry building were the quietest and most comfortable, so she started the long walk past the Electrical Engineering and Physics Department buildings. Normal students study in the library, but the library seemed to have a magical sway over Melany; she had missed too many classes because of her love for books; she knew that she would accomplish nothing should she opt for the more traditional approach of studying in the library.

 It was beautiful out. There was the smell of ozone in the air from a light shower earlier that morning, and the trees had just started to change colors. The pavement was dark with moisture, and the sun just barely peeked out from behind the clouds. It was the kind of scene Melany didn't really expect to see on campus because it was too picture-perfect; it was the kind of thing you saw in the brochures and recruitment pamphlets, but never in real life.

With a smile that resulted in at least 5 guys falling in love with her every semester, Melany walked right past the library on her way to the chemistry building. Because Abstract Algebra was so... abstract, it took considerable mental effort to understand and even more effort to understand it correctly. This was why Melany camped out in the study room for a grand total of 17 hours. Well, it was actually 21 hours, but sleeping doesn't count. Melany focused so completely on her upcoming exam that she completely forgot about the conversation she overheard, and thus never found the tattered old journal in an equally tattered cardboard box in one of the storage rooms in the new library building. Because Melany didn't find the book, she couldn't read the scribbles inside the cover, and because she couldn't read the warning inside the cover of the book, she couldn't roll her eyes and ignore it completely and experience the consequences. Because none of this happened, the story ends here, with Melany becoming a successful small business owner and tackling the world's problems. Only small for a while though, you can't seriously expect stagnation from such an impressive student.

At least, that's what she wished had happened. Melany never made it to the chemistry building that morning. She had a work study job at the library for the last three semesters, so it was completely natural for Melany to instinctually walk down the stairs through the recessed library doors.

The university had recently built a newer, larger library building, so all of the books had to be boxed up and moved from the old library to the new one. This had been her work study job, because the move offered the perfect opportunity to go through and clean up the library's catalogue. There was only one room of book boxes left. These boxes were much older than the other boxes containing the catalogued books. They must have been found in some random closet in the old library basement. Her boss, the librarian, had told her that he was going to just throw them all out the next day because his bosses firmly believed in bringing the library into the 21st century, which apparently meant old things weren't worth keeping around. Anyways, he had given her permission to look through the boxes and keep anything she wanted, which as you may guess, was far more appealing to Melany than studying.

---

After an hour or two of blissful browsing through the boxes of books, Melany found a box that rattled as she lifted it off the shelf. Inside, she found a set of ancient drafting tools among with what looked like initial drafts of the old library plans. She had always enjoyed going to flea markets with her mother; she liked finding gems from ages past. Who knew what kind of treasures you could find? The possibilities were endless. Somewhat giddy, she set the box down near the door intent on selling the tools on Ebay. She was, after all, a college student.

The next box was slightly heavier. The cardboard disintegrated at her touch, which resulted in a cloud of dust, a pile of leather bound notebooks, and a very pissed Melany. Letting loose a handful of words at the surprise and the pungent smell of... something, she kicked what was left of the box into the corner of the room.

The notebooks looked like the Moleskine notebooks many of the more privileged students liked to use to make themselves feel more sophisticated, though obviously much much older. They looked worn, and unlike the notebooks many of her pretentious peers used, they looked like they might contain something worth writing down. Wrinkling her nose, she sat down cross-legged and began to go through the books.

They were all hand-written, in a beautiful script no one seems to know how to write in anymore. Despite not having lined paper, the lines of text were as level and uniform as anything a printer could form. Before a more detailed reading, she flipped through the pages of several of them. The text was occasionally broken up by carefully drawn diagrams and equations. Perfect. Melany didn't know what she was going to pick for her topic for next semester's capstone research project, so maybe these might help inspire.

Books have a magical smell, old books most of all. But the leather bindings these journals had must have been improperly tanned, because it smelled like their covers were rotting. Sighing, Melany began to stack the notebooks in the box of drafting tools she had found earlier. She hesitated when she picked up one volume that was more tattered than the rest. What remained of the cover was discolored. The author must have returned to this volume again and again. Either that or the author attempted to destroy the journal with a food blender. Regardless, it promised to be interesting.

Feeling like she won the lottery, Melany promised herself that she would resume her trek to the chemistry building and study for her upcoming exam once she unloaded her box of goodies to her car. Surprisingly, it was a promise she kept, though she frequently wished she could turn her attention to her new acquisition.

It was a successful study session, but when she finished, she was far too exhausted for more mental effort, so Melany drove to her apartment and lost herself for a few hours in the harm loving embrace of Netflix.

After sleeping in the next morning and performing the typical college student morning routine, she made it to her desk right as her humanities professor began lecturing. Melany had a full day of classes right up until the hour before her Abstract Algebra exam. She was an astoundingly intelligent student, and knew exactly what and how to study for the exam.

---

Too bad it didn't help. For the first time, Melany felt like she could identify with the two students retaking the class for the third time over. Nothing came easily. Had she been able to concentrate, Melany would have gotten yet another perfect score; abstract mathematics just came easy to her. Normally, anyways. Every time she started down a train of thought, she would lose focus. All she could seem to think about was what she found in the library the day before. This continued for the entire exam, earning a concerned look from the professor when she failed to turn in her exam fourty-five minutes early as usual. Despite her best efforts, she just couldn't seem to focus, almost leaving her in tears when the professor indicated time had run out.

At least it was a Friday.

When she got home, Melany grabbed the tub of ice cream from the freezer and headed to the couch. After a depressingly few number of spoonfuls she finished off the cookie dough ice cream, and curled up with a book a friend had recommended her. A few pages in, she cursed under her breath and decided that it was time to see what she had failed her exam for.

After lugging the box of books and drafting instruments up the stairs to her apartment, she grabbed one of the notebooks and a blanket and curled up on a surprisingly comfortable couch that looked like it belonged in one of those construction dumpsters.

The smell of the rotting leather covers seemed stronger than she remembered from the day before, but she didn't mind. The foul smell fit her foul mood.

---

The more she read though, the less she cared about her recent embarrassment. The notebooks were extremely interesting. It took a while to figure out what they were about, but it was some sort of metamathematical philosophy regarding the purpose of the study of mathematics.

After several hours, Melany fell asleep on her worn old couch with one of the notebooks on her lap. Over the next day and a half, Melany spent her time reading the notebooks on and off. The exact details of what they contained isn't important, only that it was... odd, but not in a way she felt she could put her finger on.

On Mondays Melany had a pretty light course load that started later in the day. This was by design; she had done the calculus class at 7:30 every morning thing before, and not surprisingly, didn't enjoy it. On her way out the door, she grabbed one of the notebooks from the counter to read during one of her breaks between classes. It happened to be the one she initially hesitated on.

---

Throughout the other volumes, whoever wrote them made mention of a specific book, but seemed to treat it as a discrete unit, never attempting to dive deep into its properties. It was almost as if the author treated it with fear, which is absurd. Math is something beautiful, something to delight in, not something to fear.

After her first class of the day, Melany had a two hour block a free time, during which she took the notebook out of her backpack and began to read. Because of the notebook's state of disrepair, the text on the first few pages was difficult to make out, but with enough squinting it was easy enough to read. It was a warning. Melany shouldn't read it the note said. Bad things will happen it said.

Melany was an intelligent person, and believed only in the explainable. All logical and rational thought scoffed at the ideas of hauntings or curses. It was more curious to Melany that another person might believe such things strongly enough to leave a warning to the potential reader than the possibility of something unnatural. Like a child told not to think about ice cream she immediately ignored the warning and began to read. At about the same time she flipped the first page, another student opened the door to the outside, letting in a surprisingly chilly breeze for the time of year.

The journal was written in different handwriting; instead of being the beautiful blue script of the other journals, this was scratchy jagged writing. As soon as she began to make sense of the text, she realized that this must have been what the other notebooks referenced. Melany could immediately see that the volume she was currently reading was written by a different author than the rest of the notebooks; the difference in writing style and vocabulary was obvious.

What wasn't obvious was what exactly she was reading. The language the writer used grew more and more demented, and made less and less sense. By the time she reached the middle of the notebook, Melany could only decipher it with great difficulty. Not that it mattered, it didn't make much sense. She read it really only out of morbid curiosity, wondering what could cause a man to be so stark raving mad.

The next class Melany had was horribly boring, so Melany was looking for an excuse to skip. She found one. The very next page in the notebook contained what the writer seemed to think the capstone to his maniacal renderings. This was what the note inside the cover warned about.

---

Melany had a nasty habit of muttering under her breath as she read, and as any good mathematics student knows, you need to read things multiple times to gain a better understanding of them. It was a short poem of sorts, though not well worded, and in the author's crude script. Each time she read the author's scratchings it made more sense. In fact, each time she read it, the rest of the notebooks made more and more sense, and not just sense, they became more beautiful, and more enticing, ultimately welcoming her in their arms.

It was an incantation, you could say. A sort of summoning, in the same manner as *Bloody Mary* or similar other ridiculous nonsense. What it summoned, Melany didn't know, only that she now saw the big picture. The pieces clicked, and she understood the writings in the other journals. More than that though, she understood them more clearly than it seemed was possible.

Abandoning the rest of her classes for the day, and as it turned out for the rest of the year, she took the notebook and drove home. Once she stepped through the door the first thing she did was grab one of the notebooks she had set aside for her classes next semester. This was more important.

She not only understood what the rest of the notebooks were saying, she knew what they intended to say. She felt a primal need to finish what the previous author started.

---

This is what she overheard several days earlier. A graduate student named John something had gone crazy. Very crazy. He read the tattered notebook too, though it wasn't nearly as worn when he had it. It was he who wrote the leather bound notebooks in the beautiful blue cursive script. In fact he wrote more than the ones she found, but they had been lost long ago.

When John ran out of notebooks, he wrote on any scraps of loose paper he found. When that ran out, he wrote on the walls. And then his skin. No matter the pen, nor the surface, his writings were completely uniform and beautiful. He started writing and didn't stop, not to eat, not to use the facilities, and definitely not for something so unnecessary as sleep.

When his friends attempted to stop him, he attacked them, killing one with a deftly placed pen to the neck, and seriously injuring another.  He wrote until he was unable to hold a pen. And then he wrote some more. His dying act was to write a single perfect letter on his lower torso. It was quite a startling thing to behold. His skin would have been oddly beautiful if there hadn't been so little of it. A full two weeks had passed since John first picked up a pen, he shouldn't have lived as long as he did with no food or water.
