The [`speech-dispatcher`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/speech-dispatcher.1.html) package, installed by default on Ubuntu 14.04+, provides the [`spd-say`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/spd-say.1.html) command. Here's a brief description of how to use it.

`spd-say [options] "text"` will attempt to speak `"text"` from your device's speakers.

Here's an incomplete list of options. See `info spd-say` for the complete list and more.

* `--rate`, sets the speech rate from `-100` to `+100`
* `--pitch`, sets the speech pitch from `-100` to `+100`
* `--volume`, sets the speech volume from `-100` to `+100`
* `--voice-type` sets the preferred voice type. Options are `male1`, `male2`, `male3`, `female1`, `female2`, `female3`, `child_male`, and `child_female`
* `--punctuation-mode [none | some | all]` will set how much punctuation will be spoken
* `--pipe-mode` will accept input from `stdin` and will output to both `stdout` and `speech-dispatcher`
* `--wait` will wait until the message is spoken before exiting
* `--stop` will stop speaking the current message
* `--cancel` will cancel all messages

Example usages might be

```shell
~ $ for _ in {1..10}; do spd-say --wait "butts butts butts butts"; done
```

```shell
~ $ shuf -n 1  /usr/share/dict/words | spd-say --pipe-mode
```

```shell
~ $ curl -s https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.006/s08/lecturenotes/files/t8.shakespeare.txt | tail --lines=+246 | spd-say --pipe-mode
```

On Ubuntu, you can also change your device's volume from the terminal with `amixer -D pulse sset Master 50%` to set the volume to 50%, or `amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%[+|-]` to set the volume relative to its current level.

All of this works over SSH too ;)
