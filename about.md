I'm a junior Applied and Computational Mathematics student, with a minor in Computer Science, at the [South Dakota School of Mines and Technology](http://www.sdsmt.edu/). I've really enjoyed my time here in the Black Hills. My interests range from discrete math and computer science to Minecraft and [Ace of Spades](http://buildandshoot.com). Recently I've been participating in SDSMT's robotics team, and have greatly enjoyed myself. My favorite programming languages are Python and C.
