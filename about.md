I'm an Applied and Computational Mathematics student at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. Hopefully I'll graduate. My interests range from math and computer science to Minecraft and [Ace of Spades](http://buildandshoot.com). I'm only a little bit intelligent, so it takes what feels like a ton of effort to pick up on even the little things. I've decided to make a blog because of Matt Might's blog [post](http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-blog-as-an-academic/) about blogging as an academic. I think writing about things I'm either comfortable with or struggle with will help me learn and grow as a student.
