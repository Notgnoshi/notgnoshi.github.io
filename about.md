I am a sophomore Applied and Computational Mathematics student, with a minor in Computer Science, at [SDSMT](http://www.sdsmt.edu/). I've really enjoyed my time here in the Black Hills so far. My interests range from discrete math and computer science to Minecraft and [Ace of Spades](http://buildandshoot.com). It was actually scripting server-side mods for Ace of Spades that prompted me to learn programming. In the future, I would really like to use what I learn here at SDSMT to solve relevant data science problems in Python (my language of choice).

I'm not a fan of so called "word problems"; I greatly prefer the more abstract math for math's sake, which makes my choice of school and major interesting. I'm studying math so that I can (presumably) use it though; so that means I should probably get used to the idea of applying abstract mathemagicalness to the real world. Sniffle.
