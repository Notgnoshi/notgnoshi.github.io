[I'm](https://twitter.com/notgnoshi) a junior Applied and Computational Mathematics student, with a minor in Computer Science, at [SDSMT](http://www.sdsmt.edu/). I've really enjoyed my time here in the Black Hills so far. My interests range from discrete math and computer science to Minecraft and [Ace of Spades](http://buildandshoot.com). It was actually scripting server-side mods for Ace of Spades that prompted me to learn programming. Recently I've been participating in SDSMT's robotics team, and have greatly enjoyed myself. My favorite programming languages are Python and C.

I'm not a fan of so called "word problems" (unless they're interesting); I greatly prefer the more abstract math for math's sake, which makes my choice of school and major interesting. I'm studying math so that I can use it though; so that means I should probably get used to the idea of applying abstract mathemagicalness to the real world. Sniffle.
