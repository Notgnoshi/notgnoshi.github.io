I'm an Applied and Computational Mathematics major at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. I've really enjoyed my time here in the Black Hills. My interests range from discrete math and computer science to Minecraft and [Ace of Spades](http://buildandshoot.com). I'm only a little bit intelligent, so it takes what feels like a ton of effort to pick up on even the little things. I'm not such a great programmer, and I'm more interested in math than computer science, so I picked applied math as my major. However, I'm not a fan of so called "word problems"; I greatly prefer the more abstract math for math's sake. Who knows though, that might change. In any case, I'm studying math so that I can use it (presumably), so that means I should probably get used to the idea of applying abstract mathemagicalness to the real world. Sniffle.

I've decided to make a blog because of Matt Might's blog [post](http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-blog-as-an-academic/) about blogging as an academic. I think writing about things I'm either comfortable with or struggle with will help me learn and grow as a student. I'm not sure how seriously I'll take it, but I figured I'd give it a shot.
