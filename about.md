I'm a sophomore Applied and Computational Mathematics student at [SDSMT](http://www.sdsmt.edu/). I've really enjoyed my time here in the Black Hills. My interests range from discrete math and computer science to Minecraft and [Ace of Spades](http://buildandshoot.com).

I'm only a little bit intelligent, so it takes what feels like a ton of effort to pick up on even the little things. I'm not such a great programmer, and I'm more interested in math than computer science, so I picked applied math as my major. However, I'm not a fan of so called "word problems"; I greatly prefer the more abstract math for math's sake. Who knows though, that might change. In any case, I'm studying math so that I can use it (presumably), so that means I should probably get used to the idea of applying abstract mathemagicalness to the real world. Sniffle.
